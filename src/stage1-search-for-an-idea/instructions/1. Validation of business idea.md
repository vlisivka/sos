# Validation of business idea before investing in it too much.

Jason Cohen, founder and CTO of WP Engine, talks about the importance of
validating a business idea before investing too much time and money into
it. He suggests talking to at least 50 people to get their feedback on
the idea. It is also important to focus on things like whether people
think the idea is good, whether you can find and reach potential
customers, and whether you can convert them into paying customers.

Validation is about learning the truth about the market, customers, and
their problems, values, and willingness to pay. It's also important to
understand the language customers use to describe their problems and
features, as this will help you craft the right messaging for your
website and product.

If you're on the right track, the conversations with potential customers
will eventually become boring because you already know what they're
going to say. This is a good sign that you understand your customers
well and can now focus on building your product or service.

If things don't work out as planned, don't be afraid to pivot or change
your approach. It's important to be open to feedback and willing to
adjust your plans accordingly.

Overall, this video provides valuable insights into the importance of
validating a business idea before launching it. It also offers practical
tips on how to conduct effective customer interviews and gather
feedback.


## How to Conduct Effective Customer Interviews and Gather Feedback

Effective customer interviews are essential for understanding your
target audience and refining your product or service. Here's a
step-by-step guide:

### Preparation

1. Define your goals: Clearly outline what you want to learn from the
   interview. Are you looking for pain points, feature validation, or user
   experience insights?

2. Identify your target audience: Determine who you want to interview.
   Clearly define the ideal customer profile.

3. Develop an interview guide: Create a list of open-ended questions
   that will help you achieve your goals. Avoid leading questions and stick
   to topics that are relevant to your research.

4. Practice: Conduct a mock interview to refine your questions and
   interview flow.

### Conducting the Interview

1. Create a comfortable environment: Make the interviewee feel relaxed
   and welcome.

2. Active listening: Pay close attention to what the customer is
   saying. Show genuine interest in their thoughts and opinions.

3. Encourage storytelling: Ask open-ended questions that allow
   customers to share their experiences in detail.

4. Observe body language: Pay attention to nonverbal cues that can
   provide additional insights.

5. Take notes: Jot down key points during the interview, but focus on
   active listening.

### After the Interview


1. Transcribe the interview: If possible, transcribe the interview for
   detailed analysis.

2. Analyze the data: Identify patterns, themes, and insights from the
   interviews.

3. Share findings: Communicate your findings to the relevant team
   members.

### Tips for Effective Customer Interviews

    gain more insights.

2. Be open-minded: Avoid preconceived notions and be receptive to
    new ideas.

3. Show gratitude: Thank the participants for their time and
    insights.

4. Offer incentives: Consider offering small incentives to encourage
    participation.

5. Use a mix of interview methods: Combine in-person, phone, and
    online interviews to reach a wider audience.

### Example Questions
