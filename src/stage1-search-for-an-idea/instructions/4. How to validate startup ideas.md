# How to validate startup ideas.

In the video, Y Combinator partner Kevin Hale shares how to evaluate
startup ideas. Here are the key points from the video:

1. Evaluating a startup idea is a useful skill when you are pivoting
   your startup or when you are trying to figure out why your current
   startup is not growing.

2. Y Combinator does not only fund companies with lots of traction.
   There are many examples of companies that got accepted into Y Combinator
   with just an idea.

3. A startup idea is a hypothesis about why a company can grow quickly.
   It can be broken down into three parts: 

      - Problem: The problem is the initial condition of the company
        that allows it to grow quickly. It should be retailated to the
        user, not the technology. The problem should be popular, growing,
        urgent, expensive to solve, mandatory, and frequent.

      - Solution: The solution is the experiment that the company runs
        to solve the problem and allow the company to grow quickly.

      - Insight: The insight is the company's unfair advantage over its
        competitors. It's the explanation of why the solution will end up
        successful. It has to be related to growth, meaning that it should
        explain why the company will grow quickly.

4. There are five characteristics of a good problem for a startup:
    1. Popular

      **Many people are experiencing the problem.** This indicates a large potential market for your solution.
      **Example:** Difficulty in booking appointments for doctors.

    2. Growing

      **The problem is increasing in prevalence or severity.** This suggests a growing market opportunity.
      **Example:** The rise of online shopping and the corresponding increase in package theft.

    3. Urgent

      **People feel a strong need to solve the problem quickly.** This creates a sense of urgency for your solution.
      **Example:** A critical bug in software that is causing significant disruptions.

    4. Expensive to Solve

      **There is a significant cost associated with solving the problem.** This can create a pricing opportunity for your solution.
      **Example:** The high cost of traditional healthcare treatments.

    5. Mandatory

      **People feel obligated to solve the problem.** This indicates a strong demand for a solution.
      **Example:** Compliance with government regulations.

    6. Frequent

      **The problem occurs regularly.** This ensures a consistent need for your solution.
      **Example:** Daily traffic congestion.

   It is important to start with the problem first and then find a
   solution.

5. The insight is the unfair advantage that a company has over its
   competitors. There are five types of unfair advantages: founder,
   technology, market, distribution, and network effects.
