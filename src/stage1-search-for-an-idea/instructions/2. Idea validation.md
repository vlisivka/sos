# Idea validation

The speaker talks about different validation methods and their pros and
cons. The speaker also shares their own experience in using different
validation methods.

Here is a summary of the video:

+-----------------+----------+-----------+
| Method          | Cost     | Value     |
+-----------------+----------+-----------+
| User survey     | Very Low | Low       |
| User interviews | Low      | Medium    |
| Show Mock Ups   | Medium   | Very Low  |
| Fake Door       | Medium   | High      |
| Actual Usage    | High     | Very High |
+-----------------+----------+-----------+
Table: Idea validation methods

1. User surveys are easy to do but have low value because people often
say they will do something but never actually do it. Skip it.

2. User interviews are slightly better than user surveys but still have
low value because people often don't want to say anything that upsets
you.

3. Show mock-ups is a _user research_ thing and is not a good way to
validate _startup ideas_. Skip it.

5. Fake doors is a good way to validate startup ideas because it allows
you to see if people are actually interested in your product. Start with it.

6. Actual usage is the best way to validate startup ideas but it takes
the most work.

The speaker recommends starting with fake doors, then doing user
interviews, and then eventually graduating to actual usage.

In the video, the speaker discusses different ways to validate a startup
idea, including a validation method called fake doors. A fake door is a
website or landing page that you create to generate interest in your
product without actually having the product built yet. This can be a
great way to test whether or not there is demand for your product
without investing a lot of time and money into building it first.  

Once you have created your fake door, you can start driving traffic to
it through advertising, social media, or other marketing channels. You
can then track how many people sign up for your email list or request
more information about your product. This will give you a good idea of
whether or not there is interest in your product and whether or not it
is worth pursuing further.



1. Fake door testing is a technique used to validate demand for a
product before investing in its development.

2. It involves inviting customers to use a feature that is not ready
(but that may be in development) to see how many of them will be
interested.

3. Key benefits of running fake door tests include validating your
product or new feature idea before committing to its development,
refining your pricing strategy before the launch, and enlisting beta
testers

4. Careless use of fake door tests can create disappointed and
disgruntled users, and damage your credibility.

5. To avoid alienating your users, be transparent and honest. Show users
the potential value of the new features/products, and try to engage them
in the development process (e.g. by participating in beta testing).

6. Limit the segment size for your tests to minimize the fallout.

7. You can run fake door tests for potential customers (via your
website) or existing users (via in-app messaging)

8. Fake door testing steps: segment your audience, decide on which
landing page your fake test should trigger, create the fake door test
content, build the follow-up, and track the success of the test.

9. When using a landing page, test one thing at a time to enable
reliable tracking.

10. For in-app tests, be careful not to frustrate your users with too
many fake doors.
