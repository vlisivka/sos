# Most common mistakes of startup founders

1. Building something that doesn't solve a real problem. It's important
  to start with a problem and then find a solution, not the other way
  around.

2. Getting stuck on common startup ideas that have been around for a
  long time. These ideas are often called "tar pit ideas" because they're
  so common and so many people have tried to do them before.

3. Jumping into the first idea that comes to mind without considering
  whether it's a good business.

4. Waiting for the perfect startup idea. There's no such thing as a
  perfect startup idea, so it's important to start with something and
  iterate from there.
