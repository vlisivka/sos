<p>And you aren’t whining. I’m not a soldier; most of my family are, and
I just worked as a subcontractor building countermeasures for incoming
ordinance.</p>
<p>Let’s talk sometime soon and maybe I can get you in touch with one of
my colleagues. The problem with finding a niche is that if you’re not an
expert at that niche before you start, you’re going to set yourself up
for failure. I’m not suggesting that no one can learn as they go, but
when you’re solo, valuable problems will take more than a single
lifetime to turn profitable. That’s another reason why everyone suggests
having co-founders: it decreased every dimension of mental-load and
skill required.</p>
<p>Actually, to clarify, IMHO, valuable problems are heavily
multidisciplinary. Killer-Apps are fleeting.</p>
