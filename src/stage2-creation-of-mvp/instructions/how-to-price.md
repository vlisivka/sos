# How to price your software as a B2B startup

The speaker suggests that the price should be a third of the value that
your product delivers to the customer. You can calculate the value by
identifying the problem your product solves and how much it saves the
customer.

The speaker also recommends considering your costs and competition when
setting your price. Your price should be at least three times your cost
to maintain a healthy profit margin. If there's a lot of competition,
you should differentiate your product instead of engaging in a price
war.

Finally, the speaker provides some additional tips for pricing, such as
using a simple pricing structure, offering free trials or pilots, and
playing to your strengths as a startup.

Overall, the speaker emphasizes the importance of finding the right
price for your product and not being afraid to experiment. You can
always adjust your price later as your product improves and you get more
feedback from customers.
