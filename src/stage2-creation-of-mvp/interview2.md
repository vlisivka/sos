And you aren't whining. I'm not a soldier; most of my family are, and I just worked as a subcontractor building countermeasures for incoming ordinance.

Let's talk sometime soon and maybe I can get you in touch with one of my colleagues. The problem with finding a niche is that if you're not an expert at that niche before you start, you're going to set yourself up for failure. I'm not suggesting that no one can learn as they go, but when you're solo, valuable problems will take more than a single lifetime to turn profitable. That's another reason why everyone suggests having co-founders: it decreased every dimension of mental-load and skill required.

Actually, to clarify, IMHO, valuable problems are heavily multidisciplinary. Killer-Apps are fleeting.
